# WoW iLvl Lookup
Looks up an iLvl from the Cutthroat Comrades.

Also available at http://tomstanley.me/page/ilvls/ilvl-lookup-main.html, but may be less up to date than the Github version.

## Eventually will:

- Be able to search any guild
- Display characters in "leaderboard" order, highest iLvl at the top
